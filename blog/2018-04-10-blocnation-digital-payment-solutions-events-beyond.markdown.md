The blocnation product market fit is to provide digital payment solutions for events and other cross border industries.  I went to the [subsonic music festival in 2017](https://www.outix.co/tickets/event/subsonic-music-festival-2018) and this was the problem I found was common to many of the current solutions event organisers have to choose from.


## Problems with existing digital





 	
  * Have to buy a wristband for one event

 	
  * Have to load it with money with a transaction fee

 	
  * Unable to transfer small amounts out of payment solution because of high transaction fees




## Problems with travelling to an event in a foreign country





 	
  * Currency conversion fees

 	
  * Credit card fees




## Blocnation solves this with digital payment solutions for events





 	
  * Download the app

 	
  * Sync the app with the reusable wristband

 	
  * Load the app with blocnation credits (BNTN blockchain coins)

 	
  * Trade unused BNTN back to your preferred currency on Komodo's BarterDEX network


When you are the "seller" on the BarterDEX network, you pay no trading fee.  Even if you are the "buyer", the fee is 0.15% and it goes to the maintainers of the network - the users!  This is in the form of DEX, REVS, JUMBLR coins that are native blockchains within the Komodo ecosystem.  BNTN is also one of these.

Creating a native blockchain solution to a business problem is exactly what [PouchNation](https://pouchnation.com/) has done with their [Blocnation](https://blocnation.io/) project.  Their [native blockchain is secured by Bitcoin's enormous hashrate utilising Komodo's Security Services](https://i.mylomylo.com/notarising-blockchains-westpac-bank-blockchain-software-example/) - the delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) technology - an environmentally friendly innovation from Komodo to leverage Bitcoin's infrastructure.  The same technology that can be used by aircraft software or a banking application - or a national currency.
