To update Agama Wallet and not lose the zcash params or the downloaded blockchain, you first uninstall Agama.  This process is done through the "Installer App" as if you were installing anyway.  The installer will first run and detect an old version of Agama leaving zcash params and blockchain intact.  It will uninstall then exit.  You will then re-run the installer and it will install the fresh download.

The whole process takes less than 3 minutes.  Below is a gallery of the screenshots in order of the steps:
