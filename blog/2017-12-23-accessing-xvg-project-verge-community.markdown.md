I am not involved with the XVG Project, but it's mooning in December 2017 has been impressive with a 40x increase.    The market is (nonsensical) crazy, I think XVG is the biggest pump of 2017.  This post is a quick analysis about it's accessibility and information about the project and what I perceive to be important.  I do not hold any XVG, but this post will focus on the positives.
